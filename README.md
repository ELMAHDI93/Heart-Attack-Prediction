# Heart Attack Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on clinical and lifestyle data. The goal is to provide an accurate, interpretable model that can assist in early detection and preventive healthcare.

## 📌 Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction of heart attack risk can save lives.  
This project uses a dataset containing health indicators (such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more) to train and evaluate classification models.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise)
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels
- Thalassemia type
